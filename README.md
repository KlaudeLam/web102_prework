## Notes

This development process was an invaluable learning experience. It reinforced my grasp of webpage structure, responsive design principles, and clean coding practices. Notably, it honed my problem-solving and organizational abilities by breaking down complex tasks into modular, single-responsibility components using JavaScript. Throughout the project, proactively seeking learning resources and documentation to bridge knowledge gaps or troubleshoot issues underscored the significance of effectively navigating online resources and leveraging developer communities. 

Overall, this project provided a hands-on opportunity to strengthen my front-end development skills and problem-solving mindset.
